//  Difficulty: Data Structures, Modern Operators and Strings
// ============================================

// We're building a football betting app (soccer for my American friends ðŸ˜…)!
// Suppose we get data from a web service about a certain game ('game' variable on
// next page). In this challenge we're gonna work with that data.

// Data

const game = {

// ðŸ”¹ Task:

// 1. Create one array for each teamâ€™s players (players1, players2).

const [player1, players2] = game.players;
console.log(player1, players2);

// 2. From players1, extract the goalkeeper (gk) and the array of field players (fieldPlayers1).

const [gk, ...fieldPlayers] = player1;

console.log(gk, fieldPlayers);

// 3. Create an array allPlayers containing all players from both teams.

const allPlayers = [...player1, ...players2];
console.log(allPlayers);
// 4. Real Madrid used 2 substitutes during the game: 'Camavinga' and 'Joselu'. Create a new array players1Final with all the original team1 players plus these two.

const players1Final = [...player1, 'Camavinga', 'Joselu'];
console.log(players1Final);
// 5. Destructure the odds from game.odds into three variables: team1, draw, and team2.
const {
  odds: { team1, draw, team2 },
} = game;

console.log(team1, draw, team2);
// 6. Write a function printGoals(...players) that prints the number of goals and who scored them.

const printGoals = function (...players) {
  console.log(players);
};
printGoals(...game.scored);
// 7. Log to the console which team is more likely to win without using if/else or ternary operators.
console.log(team1 < team2 && `Team 1 winn`);
