# ðŸ§± Pyramid Generator â€“ freeCodeCamp Project

This project is part of the **"Learn Introductory JavaScript by Building a Pyramid Generator"** course on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The goal is to solidify the fundamentals of JavaScript through hands-on practice by building a dynamic pyramid pattern generator.

## âœ… What I Learned

Throughout this project (77% completed), I learned and practiced the following core JavaScript concepts:

- **Arrays** â€“ how to store and manipulate lists of characters or rows of the pyramid.
- **Strings** â€“ how to build rows using repeated characters and string concatenation.
- **Loops** â€“ used `for` and/or `while` loops to control the number of rows and characters per line.
- **Functions** â€“ wrote reusable functions to generate and display the pyramid pattern.
- **Conditional Logic** â€“ applied `if/else` statements to control layout and handle edge cases.
- **The Console** â€“ used `console.log()` to debug and display the pyramid output.
- **Problem-solving** â€“ broke down a complex pattern into small, repeatable logic steps.
