# Gradebook App

## Project Overview

This mini project is designed to help you review and practice JavaScript fundamentals such as functions, variables, conditionals, loops, and more. By building a Gradebook app, you'll solve small problems and deepen your understanding of the basics of JavaScript programming.

## Features

- Add student names and their grades
- Calculate average grades
- Determine letter grades based on numeric scores
- Display student grade reports

## Objectives

- Practice working with JavaScript functions and variables
- Use conditionals to assign letter grades
- Manipulate arrays and objects to store student data
- Improve problem-solving skills with practical coding challenges

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project files in your preferred code editor.
3. Review the provided starter code.
4. Implement the required features step-by-step.
5. Test your app by adding students and grades to see the output.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML/CSS (for basic UI, optional)

## How to Use

- Run the app in your browser or Node.js environment.
- Follow prompts to add student information and grades.
- View calculated averages and letter grades.

## Future Improvements
